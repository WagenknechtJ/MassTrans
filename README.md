# MassTrans
Translates a whole folder of aligned cDNA to amino acid, when given the start codon's position. Returns FASTA files 

Instructions:

- first HAVE ALL SEQUENCES ALIGNED and each in its own fasta file
- then find where the protein you want to translate starts on all sequences
- enter that value into TranscribeTranslate.java file (location labeled with a note)
- enter the folder where aligned sequences are saved, and the folder where translated sequences will be saved to, in DnaReader.java file (again, locations labeled with a note)
- run
